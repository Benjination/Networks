      "answer": "The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that enables communication and information sharing worldwide. It consists of billions of computing devices (hosts/end systems) connected through various types of links and packet switches (routers and link-layer switches). Protocols play a crucial role as they define the format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and the actions taken on message transmission and receipt. They provide the rules and conventions that enable different devices and software to communicate effectively. Examples include HTTP for web browsing, SMTP for email, TCP/IP for reliable data transmission, etc."
